The general scientific goal of the rhino project is the development and the analysis of autonomous and complex learning systems. This article briefly describes the major components of the rhino control software as they were exhibited at the competition. It also sketches the basic philosophy of the rhino architecture and discusses some of the lessons that we learned during the competition.},
